# Eeko AI Webapp

## Introduction

The **Eeko AI Webapp** is a web-based application designed to leverage artificial intelligence for Agricultural Solutions leveraging NASA's LARC api key for data which was further used to generate agricultural Insights. Built on the **Next.js** framework, it enables efficient server-side rendering and static site generation. By utilizing APIs for machine learning and data handling, Eeko AI Webapp provides high-performance AI-driven functionalities catering to diverse user needs.

With its modular architecture, the application allows for easy customization and scalability, making it a valuable tool for developers and businesses seeking to integrate sophisticated AI capabilities seamlessly.

## Features

- **Next.js Framework**: Efficient server-side rendering and static site generation, providing a solid foundation for high-performance web applications.
- **API Integration**: Integrates various APIs to manage complex data and AI tasks, ensuring smooth data processing.
- **Object Detection with YOLOv5**: Advanced object detection for real-time identification and classification.
- **Disease and Insect Detection**: Machine learning models for detecting diseases and insects, applicable in agriculture and environmental fields.
- **Meta LLaMA 3.2 11B Integration**: Incorporates a powerful language model to enhance natural language processing.
- **Optimized Font Loading**: Uses `next/font` to optimize the **Geist** font family for a modern UI.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed resources and documentation for quick learning and contribution.
- **Easy Deployment**: Simplifies deployment with Vercel, allowing for quick, hassle-free application deployment.
- **Community and Contribution**: Encourages feedback and collaboration, fostering continuous improvement.

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the result.

You can edit the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`, and the page will auto-update as you edit the file.

This project uses `next/font` to optimize and load the **Geist** font family from Vercel.
